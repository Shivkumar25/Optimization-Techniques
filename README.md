# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains the implementations of various Optimization Algorithms using the python programming language. These algorithms are explained and analysed in the book **Optimization for Engineering Design Algorithms and Examples**. 


## A Small Note

I have implemented these algorithms by myself using python and I have tested with various benchmark functions. However, if there are few anomalies kindly please let me know in the issue section so that I can correct and improve myself. Feedbacks are welcome ðŸ˜ƒ
